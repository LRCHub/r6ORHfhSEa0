Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I was standing by my window
On one cold, cold cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
Coming to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

Undertaker, undertaker, undertaker
Won't you please, please drive slow
'Cause this body that you carry
Lord, I hate to see her go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

(One more time)

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

In the sky Lord, in the sky

(All right this is Jody Payne oh, yeah).
