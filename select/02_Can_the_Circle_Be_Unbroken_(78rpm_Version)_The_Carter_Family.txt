I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day
And I saw the hearse come rolling
I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day
And I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

O Can the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better, home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Lord I told the, undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this body, you are hauling
Lord I hate to see her go

Can the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better, home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could, not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Can the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better, home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Went back home Lord
My home was lonesome
Miss my mother she was gone
All my brothers sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Can the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better, home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
